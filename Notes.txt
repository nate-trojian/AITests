Assumptions:
1. A simple organism does not acknowledge its own existence
2. An organism becomes complex when it understands that it exists
	- Actions taken to preserve its own existence (nonrandom)
		- Frequency of action in scenarios
	- Complex organisms want to reproduce in the BEST possible way
		- Best: Most likely to reproduce again
3. An organism cannot become complex passively
	- Mutation or active symbiosis is necessary to increase complexity of an organism

Complexity index of organisms:
	- Recognition of self
	- Recognition of environment
		- Predator/prey
		- Sustenance
		- Non-dynamic threats
	- Ability to reproduce
		- Necessary partners
		- Generation gap
		- Mutation rate
